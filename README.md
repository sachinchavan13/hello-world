Hello There,
This is sachin chavan, a guy who used to be passionate of coding.But set of life events took toll on his interest. He joined infosys and was chosen to work as Oracle apps DBA rather giving him some coding work. He was devastated and multple times he tried to get back to coding by learning things on his own but nothing worked. He kept going what he had in hands and now here he is again trying to get back to coding with the help of him loving friend Akshay. Hope he will do better here under akshay's guidance and help akshay built some cool applications
